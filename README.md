Demonstration of a simple javascript implementation of Turtle Logo using the HTML5 Canvas element

This was a "teach myself" experiment from late 2012/early 2013 where I wanted to learn more about AJAX (got sidetracked) and javascript targeting HTML5/Canvas. Turtle Logo was something I played with in my youth and it's proven to be big and fun enough to implement in other languages without being so big that it drags on.
